# CCK Food Menu Bot

A Telegram bot built using Java with the help of rubenlagus' [TelegramBots Library](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots).

### What can I use this for?

If you're living in Choa Chu Kang, Singapore, this bot may prove useful to you! Through the bot, users are able to view the menus of F&B establishments around the CCK neighbourhood, which allows the user to perhaps decide on their next meal, or to simply prove to their Mom that the chicken rice sold at the coffeeshop is priced at \$4.50, and not \$3.00. Halal-certified stalls are also marked as such, which allows for Muslim users to look for halal food options near them.

### Where is the data coming from?

All menu pictures have been collected by myself personally, as and when I pass by the stalls featured on the bot.

### The menu shown is outdated!

Please leave a feedback to me within the bot via the /feedback command and I will attend to it ASAP. As always, do check the last updated date for each menu before deciding on what you'd like to get for your meal.

### Why should I use this over Google Map's menu section?

While this bot was indeed inspired by Google Map's menu section, my main gripe with it was the lack of menus for food stalls within coffeeshops and non-restaurant eateries. Hence, I decided to make this bot, which focuses on providing menus for each stall specifically.
